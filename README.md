# students-DB-golang
An API using Go-lang, which for now works on the local machine. It has different endpoints for accessing all students' data(data of some students that I have saved in a text file), for accessing data of a particular student with his/her roll number, and for inserting data of a student (with a Post request).

While developing it, I have taken care of code reusability, code refactoring, error handling, parsing, and alerting if the user has made an invalid request('get' instead of ''post' and vice versa).
